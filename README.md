## Flask Application Design for an Engineering Calculator App with Export Functionality

### HTML Files

- **index.html**: Main HTML file, serves as the frontend for the calculator. It will contain the input fields for calculations, buttons for performing different operations, and a display area for showing results.
- **export.html**: HTML file for exporting calculation records. It will include a form with fields for entering a file name and choosing an export format (e.g., CSV, JSON).

### Routes

- **root_route**: Default route for the application, maps to the **index.html** file.
- **calculate_route**: Handles calculation requests from the frontend. It will receive input values, perform calculations, and return the result to be displayed on the **index.html** page.
- **export_route**: Handles export requests from the frontend. It will receive the file name and export format from the **export.html** form and generate the export file accordingly.

### Additional Considerations

- The calculation logic should be placed in a separate Python module or file to keep the routes clean and maintainable.
- The export functionality can be implemented using Flask's `send_file()` method to send the generated export file to the client.
- The application should include error handling mechanisms to gracefully handle invalid input or unexpected exceptions.
